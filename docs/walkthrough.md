This document assumes that you've installed Service Catalog onto your cluster.
If you haven't, please see the [installation instructions](./install.md). Optionally you may install
the Service Catalog CLI, svcat. Examples for both svcat and kubectl are provided
so that you may follow this walkthrough using svcat or using only kubectl.

> **NOTE:** Some commands in this document assume internet connectivity. 

<a id="install" />

# Step 1 - Installing the minibroker Server

Since the Service Catalog provides a Kubernetes-native interface to an
[Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) compatible broker
server, we'll need to install one in order to proceed with a demo.

We plan on using the minibroker for demo purposes. The codebase for that broker is
[here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/minibroker).

We're going to deploy the minibroker to our Kubernetes cluster before
proceeding, and we'll do so with the minibroker helm chart. You can find details about the chart in the minibroker
[README](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/minibroker#install-minibroker).

Otherwise, to install with sensible defaults, run the following command:

**NOTE:** The walkthrough installs a cluster-wide Broker with the defaults from minibroker.

```console
helm repo add minibroker https://minibroker.blob.core.windows.net/charts
```
If you are using Helm v3, run this command:
```console
helm install minibroker minibroker/minibroker --namespace minibroker --create-namespace
```
For older versions of Helm, use the --name option:
```console
helm install --name minibroker --namespace minibroker minibroker/minibroker
```

# Step 2 - Viewing ClusterServiceClasses and ClusterServicePlans

The controller created a `ClusterServiceClass` for each service that the minibroker
provides. We can view the `ClusterServiceClass` resources available:

```console
$ svcat get classes
     NAME      NAMESPACE          DESCRIPTION         
+------------+-----------+---------------------------+
  mariadb                  Helm Chart for mariadb     
  mongodb                  Helm Chart for mongodb     
  mysql                    Helm Chart for mysql       
  postgresql               Helm Chart for postgresql  
  redis                    Helm Chart for redis 

$ kubectl get clusterserviceclasses
NAME         EXTERNAL-NAME   BROKER       AGE
mariadb      mariadb         minibroker   5m50s
mongodb      mongodb         minibroker   5m50s
mysql        mysql           minibroker   5m50s
postgresql   postgresql      minibroker   5m50s
redis        redis           minibroker   5m50s
```

**NOTE:** The above kubectl command uses a custom set of columns.  The `NAME` field is
the Kubernetes name of the `ClusterServiceClass` and the `EXTERNAL NAME` field is the
human-readable name for the service that the broker returns.

The minibroker provides a service with the external name
`mariadb`. View the details of this offering:

```console
$ svcat describe class mariadb
  Name:              mariadb                        
  Scope:             cluster

  Tags:              mariadb, mysql, database, sql  
  Broker:            minibroker

# Step 4 - Creating a New ServiceInstance

Now that a `ClusterServiceClass` named `mariadb` exists within our
cluster's service catalog, we can create a `ServiceInstance` that points to
it.

Unlike `ClusterServiceBroker` and `ClusterServiceClass` resources, `ServiceInstance`
resources must be namespaced. Create a namespace with the following command:

```console
$ kubectl create namespace test-ns
namespace "test-ns" created
```

Then, create the `ServiceInstance`:

```console
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog/master/contrib/examples/walkthrough/mini-instance.yaml
serviceinstance.servicecatalog.k8s.io/mini-instance created
```

After the `ServiceInstance` is created, the service catalog controller will
communicate with the appropriate broker server to initiate provisioning.
Check the status of that process:

```console
$ svcat describe instance -n test-ns mini-instance
  Name:        mini-instance                                                                      
  Namespace:   test-ns                                                                            
  Status:      Ready - The instance was provisioned successfully @ 2019-06-18 02:42:55 +0000 UTC  
  Class:       mariadb                                                                            
  Plan:        10-3-22

# Step 5 - Requesting a ServiceBinding to use the ServiceInstance

Now that our `ServiceInstance` has been created, we can bind to it.
Create a `ServiceBinding` resource:

```console
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/service-catalog/master/contrib/examples/walkthrough/mini-binding.yaml
servicebinding.servicecatalog.k8s.io/mini-binding created
```

After the `ServiceBinding` resource is created, the service catalog controller will
communicate with the appropriate broker server to initiate binding. Generally,
this will cause the broker server to create and issue credentials that the
service catalog controller will insert into a Kubernetes `Secret`. We can check
the status of this process like so:

```console
$ svcat describe binding -n test-ns mini-binding
  Name:        mini-binding                                                  
  Namespace:   test-ns                                                       
  Status:      Ready - Injected bind result @ 2019-06-18 02:45:41 +0000 UTC  
  Secret:      mini-binding                                                  
  Instance:    mini-instance                                                 

Parameters:
  No parameters defined

  host                    47 bytes  
  mariadb-password        10 bytes  
  mariadb-root-password   10 bytes  
  password                10 bytes  
  port                    4 bytes   
  uri                     76 bytes

  orphanMitigationInProgress: false
  reconciledGeneration: 1
  unbindStatus: Required
```

Notice that the status has a `Ready` condition set.  This means our binding is
ready to use!  If we look at the `Secret`s in our `test-ns` namespace, we should
see a new one:

```console
$ kubectl get secrets -n test-ns
NAME                    TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
default-token-n2j75     kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      10m
mini-binding            Opaque                                8      91s
```

Notice that a new `Secret` named `mini-binding` has been created.
At this point,we could use this secret to connect the running MariaDB instance to our application running on Kubernetes.

# Step 6 - Deleting the ServiceBinding

Now, let's unbind the instance:

```console
$ svcat unbind -n test-ns mini-instance
deleted mini-binding
```

After the deletion is complete, we should see that the `Secret` is gone:

```console
$ kubectl get secrets -n test-ns
NAME                    TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
default-token-n2j75     kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3      11m
```

# Step 7 - Deleting the ServiceInstance

Now, we can deprovision the instance:

```console
$ svcat deprovision -n test-ns mini-instance
deleted mini-instance
```

# Step 8 - Deleting the ClusterServiceBroker

Next, we should remove the `ClusterServiceBroker` resource. This tells the service
catalog to remove the broker's services from the catalog. Do so with this
command:

```console
$ kubectl delete clusterservicebrokers minibroker
clusterservicebroker.servicecatalog.k8s.io "minibroker" deleted
```

We should then see that all the `ClusterServiceClass` resources that came from that
broker have also been deleted:

```console
$ svcat get classes
  NAME   NAMESPACE   DESCRIPTION
+------+-----------+-------------+

$ kubectl get clusterserviceclasses
No resources found.
```

# Step 9 - Final Cleanup

To clean up minibroker deployment, delete the helm release.

If you are using Helm v3, run this command:

```console
helm delete minibroker
```
For older versions of Helm, use the --purge option:

```console
helm delete --purge minibroker
```

Then, delete all the namespaces we created:

```console
kubectl delete ns test-ns minibroker
```

# Troubleshooting

## Firewall rules

If you are using Google Cloud Platform, you may need to run the following
command to setup proper firewall rules to allow your traffic get in.

```console
gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-service-catalog-secure --allow tcp:30443 --description "Allow incoming traffic on 30443 port."
```
